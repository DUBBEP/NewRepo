# NewRepo
 Repository for unity projects

Instead of the cube build for this assignment I decided I wanted to use an old unity project I made back in spring 2022. Its a simple 3rd person character controller that can move around jump and sprint. I hope that's okay for this assignment

Unity Build:https://dubbep.github.io/NewRepo/

Controls:

Movement:WASD

Jump: Space

Sprint: Shift

Camera: Mouse
